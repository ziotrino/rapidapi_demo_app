# covidstats_app

A sample Flutter application.


## Getting Started
this is my very first Flutter application (and first Github repo) after attending at the Udemy Flutter course from London App Brewery.
This sample app uses the covid-193 API services from RapidAPI to gather informations about COVID pandemic.
It covers various topics, as API calls, image resource handling, charts drawing (charts_flutter library), splash screen, loading progress.
As a first app, there is a huge margin of improvement i.e. error handling, state management and more.

ADVICE: To use the APIs you need to register and get a user key from RapidAPI at rapidapi.com, the use of the API it's free
